This Task View contains information about packages broadly relevated to *water*, focused on hydrology, hydrogeology, and meteorology. Packages are broadly grouped according to their function; however, many have functionality that spans multiple categories. We also highlight other, existing task views that have related functions - for example, statistical analysis or spatial data processing. 

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this Task View, go to GitHub and [submit an issue](https://github.com/ropensci/hydrometeorology/issues), or make some changes and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ropensci/hydrometeorology/pulls). If you can't contribute on GitHub, [send Sam Zipper an email](mailto:samuelczipper@gmail.com).

The [Environmetrics TaskView](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Environmetrics) gives an overview of packages used in the analysis of environmental data, including hydrological data, including many statistical approaches used in the ecological sciences. Additionally, packages that help model datasets with extreme values are discussed in the [ExtremeValue TaskView](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=ExtremeValue). 

-  <pkg>CityWaterBalance</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/CityWaterBalance)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_CityWaterBalance.html) Retrieves data and estimates unmeasured flows of water through the urban network. Any city may be modeled with preassembled data, but data for US cities can be gathered via web services using this package and dependencies <pkg>geoknife</pkg> and <pkg>dataRetrieval</pkg>. 

-   <rforge>dream</rforge> DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM). Efficient global MCMC even in high-dimensional spaces.

-   <github>cvitolo/fuse</github>[![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/fuse)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_fuse.html) an R package implementing the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors [cvitolo.github.io/fuse/](https://cvitolo.github.io/fuse/) 

-   <pkg>hydroApps</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/hydroApps)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_hydroApps.html) Package providing tools for hydrological applications and models developed for regional analysis in Northwestern Italy focused on Flood Frequency Analysis.

-   <pkg>hydroGOF</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/hydroGOF)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_hydroGOF.html) S3 functions implementing both statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit measures between observed and simulated values, mainly oriented to be used during the calibration, validation, and application of hydrological models. 

-   <pkg>HydroMe</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/HydroMe)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_HydroMe.html) Estimates the parameters in infiltration and water retention models by curve-fitting method. The models considered are those that are commonly used in soil science.

-   <pkg>hyfo</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/hyfo)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_hyfo.html) Focuses on data processing and visualization in hydrology and climate forecasting. Main function includes data extraction, data downscaling, data resampling, gap filler of precipitation, bias correction of forecasting data, flexible time series plot, and spatial map generation. It is a good pre- processing and post-processing tool for hydrological and hydraulic modellers.

-   <pkg>IDF</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/IDF)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_IDF.html) The package 'IDF' provides a function to read precipitation data from German weather service (DWD) files and Berlin station data from and additionally Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) parameters can be estimated from a given data.frame containing a precipitation time series. 

-   <pkg>LPM</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/LPM)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_LPM.html) Apply Univariate Long Memory Models, Apply Multivariate Short Memory Models To Hydrological Dataset, Estimate Intensity Duration Frequency curve to rainfall series.

-   <pkg>rtop</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/rtop)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_rtop.html): Interpolation of Data with Variable Spatial Support Geostatistical interpolation of data with irregular spatial support such as runoff related data or data from administrative units.

-   <pkg>SCI</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/SCI)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_SCI.html) Functions for generating Standardized Climate Indices (SCI). SCI is a transformation of (smoothed) climate (or environmental) time series that removes seasonality and forces the data to take values of the standard normal distribution. SCI was originally developed for precipitation. In this case it is known as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).

-   <pkg>soilwater</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/soilwater)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_soilwater.html) It implements parametric formulas of soil water retention or conductivity curve. At the moment, only Van Genuchten (for soil water retention curve) and Mualem (for hydraulic conductivity) were implemented.

-   <pkg>SPEI</pkg> [![cran checks](https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/SPEI)](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_SPEI.html) A set of functions for computing potential evapotranspiration and several widely used drought indices including the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI).
