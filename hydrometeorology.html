        This Task View contains information about packages broadly relevated to
        <em>
          water
        </em>, focused on hydrology, hydrogeology, and meteorology. Packages are broadly grouped according to their function; however, many have functionality that spans multiple categories. We also highlight other, existing task views that have related functions - for example, statistical analysis or spatial data processing.
