<!-- Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are a widely used analysis-tool in hydrology to assess extreme values of precipitation (e.g. [Mailhot et al., 2007](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.09.019)). The package 'IDF' provides a function to read precipitation data from German weather service (DWD) [webwerdis](http://www.dwd.de/EN/ourservices/webwerdis/webwerdis.html) files and Berlin station data from [Stadtmessnetz](http://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/met/service/stadtmessnetz/index.html) files, and additionally IDF parameters can be estimated also from a given data.frame containing a precipitation time series. The data is aggregated to given levels yearly intensity maxima are calculated either for the whole year or given months. From these intensity maxima IDF parameters are estimated on the basis of a duration-dependent generalised extreme value distribution ([Koutsoyannis et al., 1998](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1694(98)00097-3)).
