This package contains functions for sourcing, formatting, and editing meteorological data for hydrologic models. <a href="https://cranchecks.info/pkgs/getMet"><img src="https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/getMet" alt="cran checks" /></a></p></li><li><p><pkg>GSODR</pkg> Provides automated downloading, parsing, cleaning, unit conversion and formatting of Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) weather data from the from the USA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) for use in R. Units are converted from from United States Customary System (USCS) units to International System of Units (SI). Stations may be individually checked for number of missing days defined by the user, where stations with too many missing observations are omitted. Only stations with valid reported latitude and longitude values are permitted in the final data. Additional useful elements, saturation vapour pressure (es), actual vapour pressure (ea) and relative humidity are calculated from the original data and included in the final data set. The resulting data include station identification information, state, country, latitude, longitude, elevation, weather observations and associated flags. Data may be automatically saved to disk. File output may be returned as a comma-separated values (CSV) or GeoPackage (GPKG) file. Additional data are included with this R package: a list of elevation values for stations between -60 and 60 degrees latitude derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Measuring Mission (SRTM). For information on the GSOD data from NCEI, please see the GSOD readme.txt file available from, <a href="http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt" class="uri">http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt</a>. <a href="https://cranchecks.info/pkgs/GSODR"><img src="https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/GSODR" alt="cran checks" /></a></p></li><li><p><pkg>hydrolinks</pkg> Tools to link geographic data with hydrologic network, including lakes, streams and rivers.

These citywide surveys have been collecting data allowing water and sanitation service levels across the entire city to be characterised, while also allowing more detailed data to be collected in areas of the city of particular interest. These surveys are intended to generate useful information for others working in the water and sanitation sector. Current release version includes datasets collected from a survey conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh in March 2017. This survey in Dhaka is one of a series of surveys to be conducted by WSUP in various cities in which they operate including Accra, Ghana; Nakuru, Kenya; Antananarivo, Madagascar; Maputo, Mozambique; and, Lusaka, Zambia. This package will be updated once the surveys in other cities are completed and datasets have been made available. <a href="https://cranchecks.info/pkgs/washdata"><img src="https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/washdata" alt="cran checks" /></a></p></li><li><p><pkg>waterData</pkg> Imports U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) daily hydrologic data from USGS web services (see <a href="https://waterservices.usgs.gov/" class="uri">https://waterservices.usgs.gov/</a> for more information), plots the data, addresses some common data problems, and calculates and plots anomalies. <a href="https://cranchecks.info/pkgs/waterData"><img src="https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/waterData" alt="cran checks" /></a></p></li><li><p><pkg>WaterML</pkg> Lets you connect to any of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc.

All versions of ‘WaterML’ (1.0, 1.1 and 2.0) and both types of the web service protocol (‘SOAP’ and ‘REST’) are supported. The package has six data download functions: GetServices(): show all public web services from the HIS Central Catalog. HISCentral_GetSites() and HISCentral_GetSeriesCatalog(): search for sites or time series from the HIS Central catalog based on geographic bounding box, server, or keyword. GetVariables(): Show a data.frame with all variables on the server. GetSites(): Show a data.frame with all sites on the server. GetSiteInfo(): Show what variables, methods and quality control levels are available at the specific site. GetValues(): Given a site code, variable code, start time and end time, fetch a data.frame of all the observation time series data values. The GetValues() function can also parse ‘WaterML’ data from a custom URL or from a local file. The package also has five data upload functions: AddSites(), AddVariables(), AddMethods(), AddSources(), and AddValues(). These functions can be used for uploading data to a ‘HydroServer Lite’ Observations Data Model (‘ODM’) database via the ‘JSON’ data upload web service interface. <a href="https://cranchecks.info/pkgs/WaterML"><img src="https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/WaterML" alt="cran checks" /></a></p></li><li><p><pkg>weathercan</pkg> Provides means for downloading historical weather data from the Environment and Climate Change Canada website (<a href="http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html" class="uri">http://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html</a>).
